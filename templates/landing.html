            <h1>The Interactive Remote Overlay System</h1>
            <p>
                IROS is a simple collaborative overlay which allows you to display and arrange text, images and other
                elements on stream through a web interface. Make your streams more interactive and engaging by allowing
                your
                moderators to control the overlay from their browser.
            </p>
            <p>
                The overlay comes with a web-based editor that allows multiple users to add and edit elements in real
                time. The overlay can be added to your stream as a browser source and will automatically update when
                changes are made in the editor.
            </p>
            <p>
                See <a href="#quickstart">quickstart</a> to get started with a few simple steps or check out the <a
                    href="./docs">documentation</a> for a more thorough explanation for setting it up and a list of all
                features and how to use them.
            </p>

            <h1 id="quickstart">Quickstart</h1>
            <p>
                To get started with IROS you first need to create a new session. This will give you two links, one for
                the editor and one for the overlay. The editor is where you can add and edit elements and the overlay is
                what you will add to your stream as a browser source. The links can be generated here:
            </p>

            <h2>Create a session</h2>

            <div id="generate-form">
                <input type="text" name="stream-link" id="stream-link" placeholder="https://streamingsite/yourchannel">
                <label for="size">Size</label>
                <input type="text" name="size" id="size" placeholder="1920x1080">
                <button onclick="generate_session()">Generate</button>
            </div>
            <div id="link-container" class="hidden">
                <div class="link-display">
                    <div class="label">Editor link</div>
                    <input class="link-textbox" type="text" name="editor-link" id="editor-link" readonly>
                    <button title="Copy to clipboard" onclick="copy_link('editor-link')"><img
                            src="static/img/copy.svg" /></button>

                    <div class="label">Overlay link</div>
                    <input type=" text" name="overlay-link" id="overlay-link" readonly>
                    <button title="Copy to clipboard" onclick="copy_link('overlay-link')"><img
                            src="static/img/copy.svg" /></button>
                </div>
            </div>
            <p>
                To generate a session provide a link to your stream and optionally a size of the overlay. The link
                is used to embed the stream in the editor so you can see how the overlay will look on stream. The size
                should be the resolution of your stream. By default it will be 1920x1080.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Important:</strong> The generated links should only be shared with people you trust. Anyone that
                has access to them can use the editor to change the overlay.
            </p>

            <h2>Adding the overlay</h2>
            <p>
                To use the overlay you have to add a browser source to your streaming software and point it to the
                overlay link. The overlay will automatically update when you make changes in the editor. See the
                links below on how to use browser sources in your streaming software.
            <ul>
                <li><a href="https://obsproject.com/kb/sources-guide" target="_blank">Browser source for OBS Studio</a>
                </li>
                <li><a href="https://support.xsplit.com/en/article/webpage-1y1l6v/" target="_blank">Browser source for
                        XSplit</a>
                </li>
            </ul>
            </p>
            <h2>Using the editor</h2>
            <p>
                The editor is where you can add and edit elements displayed in the overlay. It can be accessed through
                the editor link using a browser. The editor is designed to be used by moderators so they can show
                things on stream while the streamer is AFK or otherwise occupied. Elements can be added via the
                buttons at the top of the settings panel. You can move them around by pressing <strong>G</strong>
                and then moving your mouse. The same goes for scaling and rotating with <strong>S</strong> and
                <strong>R</strong> respectively. For more information on how to use the editor see the <a
                    href="./docs">documentation</a>.
